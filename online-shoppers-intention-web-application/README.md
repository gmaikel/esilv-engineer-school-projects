# Projet-Python_2022
Project Python Analysis and Machine Learning Models

Goal
Our project aims to give more experiences in machine learning and try many machine learning and the school give to us dataset. So, we have to predict 
the online purchase intention of people and deploy an API thanks to Flask or Django but we use an other API untitled streamlit. 

Dataset presentation 
UCI Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset Data - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Shoppers+Purchasing+Intention+Dataset
The goal of the dataset analysis is to analyse a set of online shopping session that leads (or not) to a purchase. The dataset contain 12 330 session with 10 422 of the session

Selection of our model
We have choose 3 models of classifications and the names of this models is Random Forest version one and two, Gaussion naives bayes and extra trees.
We also do a comparison of these models and note that the random forest have the best accuracy. 

API
We created an API thanks to streamlit who can predict if someone have purchased or not in our website. Nevertheless, we can improve our API that we can put the code in the API and thanks to that it can be visible on internet and We can also have more graphics.
